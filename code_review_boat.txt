Feature Name :- Virtual Lane Auction Integration

	Code Review Date :- 18th and 20th Jan

	Comments/suggestions :-

		1.) Improve the language of feature files
			There is no 'then' statement(Verifications are done in When/and steps)
			Break the steps which are having 'and' as conjuctive keyword

		2.) Improve the code of step defs as well
			Biggest blunder is using begin-rescue in the Verification statement. This will never fail your test even incase of application issue as well
			The code between the steps should be minimal. Instead write methods in classes and just call them in steps
			Classes(methods and page objects) are kept in the file which is present the step_definitions folder. Instead it should be kept in different folder(maybe named as page objects). Step_definition folder should only contain steps
